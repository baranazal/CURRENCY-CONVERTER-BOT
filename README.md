A simple and easy-to-use currency converter that can convert between different currencies.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following packages:

- python-telegram-bot

You can install this package using pip:

```
pip install python-telegram-bot==13.3
```


### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/baranazal/CURRENCY-CONVERTER-BOT.git
```


Or you can download it manually 

### Running the converter

```

The currency converter should now be running and ready for use.

## Usage

To use the currency converter, simply enter the amount of money you want to convert and the codes for the source and target currencies. For example, if you want to convert 100 USD to EUR, you would enter 100 USD to EUR exactly like this or it won't work with you.
